# source-ranges-controller

NOTE: This is an alpha-status project. We do regular tests on the code and functionality, but we can not assure a production-ready stability.

Source Ranges Controller sets loadBalancerSourceRanges to Kubernetes Services through a ConfigMap

## Requirements
Source Ranges controller is meant to be run on Kubernetes 1.8+.
All dependecies have been vendored, so there's no need to any additional download.
